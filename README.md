# WEATHER-API

-> My weather app is a client-side application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to search for the current weather in any city by submitting a form. Once a city is entered, the app sends a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and your unique API key. The API responds with JSON data that includes temperature, humidity, pressure, cloud coverage, weather icon, and country code. This data is then dynamically displayed in your UI using JavaScript.

-> The technologies used in this project include:
- **HTML** for structuring the interface.
- **CSS** for styling and enhancing visual design with animations and layout.
- **JavaScript** for handling user input, API communication, and DOM manipulation.
- **Font Awesome** for icons.
- **OpenWeatherMap API** for weather data.
- **FlagsAPI** to show the country’s flag.

-> To make it work, you need a stable internet connection, a valid API key from OpenWeatherMap, and a basic understanding of JavaScript promises (`fetch` and `.then()`) to process asynchronous API calls.

-> This app demonstrates core front-end development skills: working with forms, event listeners, JSON APIs, dynamic updates, and responsive UI design — all without needing a backend server.
